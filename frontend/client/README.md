## Database Angler - Frontend
# Overview
Our web application is a single-page application that provides a simple and modern user interface for communicating with our AI-agent. The user interface is built with React and TypeScript and styled with SCSS. We have also utilized CoreUI to give our application a polished look. The main component of the user interface is a text area where the user can write an input that our AI-agent will process. The user can run the query by clicking the "Submit" button, after which the query results, the SQL query generated by the AI-agent, and the possible visualization are displayed.

# Running the frontend
Navigate to the client folder and run "npm install" to install required dependencies and packages. After that, you can start the application by running "npm start". When the application is running, it can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/.
